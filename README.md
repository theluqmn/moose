# Moose

**Designed and developed by** [Luqman](https://theluqmn.github.io/)

Moose is a simple bank management system originally written in C++. It includes basic functionalities such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, balance checking, transaction history, transferring money, and a simple payment interface. Uses SQLite3 for data storage.

The original C++ version is available at this [release](https://github.com/TheLuqmn/Moose/releases/tag/v0.1.cpp).

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in **active** development. Currently transitioning from C++ to Rust.
