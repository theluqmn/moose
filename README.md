# Moose

**Designed and developed by** [Luqman](https://theluqmn.github.io/) | **First** C++ project!

Moose is a simple bank management system written in C++. It includes basic functionalities such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, balance checking, transaction history, transferring money, and a simple payment interface. Uses SQLite3 for data storage.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in **active** development.

## Features

- [x] Create accounts
- [x] Transfer money to other accounts (not implemented in logic but the prompt is there)
- [ ] Fetch transaction history
- [ ] Account overview
- [ ] Payment interface (for stores)

Other than banking-related features, this project also has a bash script (`run.bash`) that simplifies the compilation process.

All the features above has to be implemented in order to consider this project "done". I am interested in further developing this project, but as always, only time will tell.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure sqlite3 is installed in your system
3. Run `bash run.bash` to compile all files and run the program

## Stack

- Language: C++
- Database: SQLite3
